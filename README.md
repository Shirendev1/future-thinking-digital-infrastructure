# Future Thinking: Digital Infrastructure for Mongolia

This repository explores a systems-based vision for Mongolia’s future —
from energy consumption to regenerative digital infrastructure.

It brings together essays, strategy notes, and research frameworks focused on:
- Green and sovereign data centers
- Renewable energy and energy storage
- Data sovereignty and governance
- Human-centered, sustainable development

The work is shared as an open concept to invite dialogue, collaboration, and future research.
